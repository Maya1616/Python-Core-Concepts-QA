This repository hosts a single, comprehensive Google Colab notebook: **`Files, Exception Handling, Logging and Memory Management Questions with Answers.ipynb`**.

This notebook is a practical playbook designed to help developers master error handling, file I/O, logging strategies, and memory management in Python. It's a one-stop solution for anyone preparing for a technical interview or looking to write more robust and efficient code.

## ‚ú® Overview

Instead of just a simple Q&A list, this notebook breaks down complex concepts into understandable, executable code cells. It covers both the **"why" (Theoretical Concepts)** and the **"how" (Practical Implementations)** of crucial Python topics, all within a single, well-organized file.

---
## üß† Topics Covered

The notebook is divided into two main sections, both contained within the same file:

### 1. Theoretical Concepts
- **Languages:** Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages
- **Exception Handling:** The `try-except-else-finally` block, exception hierarchy, and raising custom exceptions.
- **Logging:** Advantages of logging over `print()`, different logging levels, and best practices.
- **Memory Management:** Python's garbage collection system, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), and memory profiling.
- **Concurrency:** The fundamental differences and use-cases for Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing.
- **File System:** The importance of closing files and the difference between `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`.

### 2. Practical Implementation
- üìÅ **File I/O:** Reading, writing, and appending to files using context managers (`with open(...)`).
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling:** Catching specific exceptions like `FileNotFoundError`, `ZeroDivisionError`, `KeyError`, and handling multiple exceptions.
- üìù **Advanced Logging:** Configuring the `logging` module to output to both console and file, setting message formats, and implementing basic log rotation.
- ‚öôÔ∏è **System Interaction:** Using the `os` module for file system operations like checking for a file's existence.
- üìä **Performance:** Demonstrating how to use `cProfile` for basic memory and performance profiling.

## üöÄ Getting Started

No setup is required! The entire project is self-contained in the Google Colab notebook.

1.  **Click the "Open in Colab" badge** at the top of this README.
2.  The notebook will open directly in your browser.
3.  Run the cells interactively to see the code, explanations, and output for each question.
